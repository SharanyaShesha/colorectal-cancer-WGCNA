# Identification of Key Genes in Colorectal Cancer Using WGCNA

This project applies **Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)** to identify key genes and potential biomarkers involved in the diagnosis and progression of **Colorectal Cancer (CRC)**. Leveraging public gene expression datasets from GEO and TCGA, this study reconstructs co-expression networks, identifies hub genes, explores their functional roles, and evaluates their prognostic value.

Developed as part of the **INFO-B 646: Computational Systems Biology** course at Indiana University, this analysis integrates systems biology, transcriptomics, survival analysis, and drug repurposing techniques.

## Overview

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. Early detection can greatly improve survival outcomes, yet current biomarker strategies are limited. This project uses WGCNA, a systems-level approach, to uncover modules of highly correlated genes and identify **hub genes** that are not only differentially expressed but are also clinically significant.

---

## Project Objectives

- Identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** in CRC tissue vs. normal tissue.
- Construct gene co-expression networks using **WGCNA**.
- Discover gene modules correlated with clinical traits such as tumor stage and metastasis.
- Perform **GO and KEGG enrichment analysis** to uncover functional pathways.
- Construct **PPI networks** and identify hub genes using **Cytoscape**.
- Validate hub gene expression in **TCGA** and additional GEO datasets.
- Perform **survival analysis** to evaluate prognostic relevance.
- Explore **miRNAâ€“mRNA interactions** and identify drug targets via **DGIdb**.

- Network construction using `WGCNA`
- Moduleâ€“trait correlation heatmaps
- GO/KEGG enrichment using `clusterProfiler`
- PPI & hub gene selection using `Cytoscape + CytoHubba`
- Validation using `TCGAbiolinks` & `GEPIA`
- Drug interactions via `DGIdb` and miRNA networks via `multiMiR`

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Highlights

- **Identified 746 DEGs** (266 upregulated, 480 downregulated)
- Constructed WGCNA modules and found **Blue & Turquoise modules** linked to CRC stage
- Identified **8 key hub genes** (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL10A1, COL11A1, BGN, THBS2)
- Functional enrichment pointed to **extracellular matrix remodeling** and **collagen formation**
- **7/8 hub genes correlated with poor prognosis** (p < 0.05)
- Found **38 drug-gene interactions**, highlighting repurposable CRC therapies
